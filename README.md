# GDP-UI-Overview

Introduction to Unity 5+ UI system. Based on the NoobTuts [Unity UI Tutorial][tut]. Tested with Unity 2017.3.

## Differences:

* Since my students are working on 2D games when we do this, I have them do it in 2D mode rather than starting in 3D and switching to a 2D view.

* Create an empty GameObject to server as a container for the UI. Move UI in after creating the Panel. Put in on the UI layer.
